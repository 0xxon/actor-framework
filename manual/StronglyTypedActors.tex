\section{Strongly Typed Actors}

Strongly typed actors provide a convenient way of defining type-safe messaging interfaces.
Unlike ``dynamic actors'', typed actors are not allowed to change their behavior at runtime, neither are typed actors allowed to use guard expressions.
When calling \lstinline^become^ in a strongly typed actor, the actor will be killed with exit reason \lstinline^unallowed_function_call^.

Typed actors use \lstinline^typed_actor_ptr<...>^ instead of \lstinline^actor_ptr^, whereas the template parameters hold the messaging interface.
For example, an actor responding to two integers with a dobule would use the type \lstinline^typed_actor_ptr<replies_to<int, int>::with<double>>^.

\subsection{Spawning Typed Actors}
\label{sec:strong:spawn}

Actors are spawned using the function \lstinline^spawn_typed^.
The argument to this function call \emph{must} be a match expression as shown in the example below, because the runtime of libcppa needs to evaluate the signature of each message handler.

\begin{lstlisting}
auto p0 = spawn_typed(
  on_arg_match >> [](int a, int b) {
   return static_cast<double>(a) * b;
  },
  on_arg_match >> [](double a, double b) {
    return make_cow_tuple(a * b, a / b);
  }
);
// assign to identical type
using full_type = typed_actor_ptr<
                    replies_to<int, int>::with<double>,
                    replies_to<double, double>::with<double, double>
                  >;
full_type p1 = p0;
// assign to subtype
using subtype1 = typed_actor_ptr<
                   replies_to<int, int>::with<double>
                 >;
subtype1 p2 = p0;
// assign to another subtype
using subtype2 = typed_actor_ptr<
                   replies_to<double, double>::with<double, double>
                 >;
subtype1 p3 = p0;
\end{lstlisting}

All functions for message passing, linking and monitoring are overloaded to accept both types of actors.
As of version 0.8, strongly typed actors cannot be published (this is a planned feature for future releases).
