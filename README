This project is in an early / experimental stage.

It makes use of variadic templates, unrestricted unions, type inference and
other features not included in the current language specification for C++.
Thus, GCC in version >= 4.6 is required to compile libcppa.

You can modify the file "Makefile.rules" to set the path to your GCC binary
and/or to compile libcppa with different compiler flags.
