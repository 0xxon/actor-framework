This project is in an early / experimental stage.

It makes use of variadic templates, unrestricted unions,
type inference and other C++11 features.
Thus, GCC in version >= 4.6 is required to compile libcppa.
You'll also need automake and the boost thread library.


Building libcppa:

* autoreconf -i
* ./configure
* make
