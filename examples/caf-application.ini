; This file shows all possible parameters with defaults.
; Values enclosed in <> are detected at runtime unless defined by the user.

; when using the default scheduler
[scheduler]
; accepted alternative: 'sharing'
policy='stealing'
; configures whether the scheduler generates profiling output
enable-profiling=false
; forces a fixed number of threads if set
max-threads=<number of cores>
; maximum number of messages actors can consume in one run
max-throughput=<infinite>
; measurement resolution in milliseconds (only if profiling is enabled)
profiling-resolution=100ms
; output file for profiler data (only if profiling is enabled)
profiling-output-file="/dev/null"

; when using 'stealing' as scheduler policy
[work-stealing]
; number of zero-sleep-interval polling attempts
aggressive-poll-attempts=100
; frequency of steal attempts during aggressive polling
aggressive-steal-interval=10
; number of moderately aggressive polling attempts
moderate-poll-attempts=500
; frequency of steal attempts during moderate polling
moderate-steal-interval=5
; sleep interval between poll attempts
moderate-sleep-duration=50us
; frequency of steal attempts during relaxed polling
relaxed-steal-interval=1
; sleep interval between poll attempts
relaxed-sleep-duration=10ms

; when loading io::middleman
[middleman]
; configures whether MMs try to span a full mesh
enable-automatic-connections=false
; application identifier of this node, prevents connection to other CAF
; instances with incompatible identifiers (at least one entry must match)
app-identifiers=["generic-caf-app"]
; maximum number of consecutive I/O reads per broker
max-consecutive-reads=50
; heartbeat message interval for periodic traffic
; (0 disables heartbeating - not recommended)
heartbeat-interval=10s
; force disconnects of CAF nodes after receiving no traffic for this amount of
; time (0 disables this feature, but we highly recommend using heartbeats and
; connection timeouts), be careful when deploying CAF applications with
; different heartbeat intervals and connection timeouts: this timeout should
; line up with the *longest* heartbeat interval (ideally it's a multiple)
connection-timeout=30s
; configures whether the MM attaches its internal utility actors to the
; scheduler instead of dedicating individual threads (needed only for
; deterministic testing)
attach-utility-actors=false
; configures whether the MM starts a background thread for I/O activity,
; setting this to true allows fully deterministic execution in unit test and
; requires the user to trigger I/O manually
manual-multiplexing=false
; configures how many background workers are spawned for deserialization,
; by default CAF uses 1-4 workers depending on the number of cores
workers=<min(3, number of cores / 4) + 1>

; when compiling with logging enabled
[logger]
; file name template for output log file files (empty string disables logging)
file-name="actor_log_[PID]_[TIMESTAMP]_[NODE].log"
; format for rendering individual log file entries
file-format="%r %c %p %a %t %C %M %F:%L %m%n"
; configures the minimum severity of messages that are written to the log file
; (quiet|error|warning|info|debug|trace)
file-verbosity='trace'
; mode for console log output generation (none|colored|uncolored)
console='none'
; format for printing individual log entries to the console
console-format="%m"
; configures the minimum severity of messages that are written to the console
; (quiet|error|warning|info|debug|trace)
console-verbosity='trace'
; excludes listed components from logging (list of atoms)
